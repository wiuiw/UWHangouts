  "description": "UW Hangouts is an application used for UW students to communicate with each other through live video feeds. This application could also be eventually extended for other universities and the general public to use. Since we are students ourselves, we wanted to create something that we could also use and benefits us. UW Hangouts could create a more focused academic environment for students to get work done. It would have less distractions than other video chat apps like Facebook Messenger. The private academically geared video chat rooms would promote group study sessions or project discussions online. Another use of UW Hangouts could be more social-based. The video chat app could make UW more inclusive with public live video chat rooms and streams/broadcasts from students all around campus. This could also help students that feel disconnected or isolated on the UW campus. It would make another way for students to connect with each other and meet other new fellow students.",
